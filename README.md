# MAYA-random-shader

A maya plugin used to randomly assign shaders. Will support adjusting distribution of colors

I first got the idea to work on this project after seeing a much more complex subject presented at SIGGRAPH about generating the shaders as well (a super fascinating read which I wish I understood better which can be found here https://users.cg.tuwien.ac.at/zsolnai/gfx/gaussian-material-synthesis/). I ended up then settling a much smaller scope project which allowed me to develop off ideas and really test my ability to apply materials learned from Udemy course Python for Maya: Artist Friendly Programming by Dhruv Govil and the book Practical Maya Programming with Python by Robert Galanakis.
